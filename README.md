# Phone-Number-Encryption-Decryption
This Java program encrypts and decrypts a ten-digit phone number by first allowing the user to input the phone number, then separating it into three parts: area code, central number, and station number. The program then encrypts each part using a simple encryption method, and finally, it decrypts the encrypted number back to its original form.
